# CBF Placebo Checker
Adds a button to the main menu that either turns CBF on or off, without telling you which.

# Why?
This mod can be used to find out if CBF is truly helping you, or if it's just the Placebo Effect.

# What is the Placebo Effect?
The Placebo Effect is originally a term used for a medication that doesn't actually do anything, but still has an effect on the person taking it because they THINK it will do something.  
It can also be applied to other things, though. For example, CBF might SEEM like it helps you, but really it only helps you because you are more confident when using it.
